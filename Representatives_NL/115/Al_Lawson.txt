The district covers all or parts of eight north Florida counties spanning from Gadsden in the west to Duval in the east.\nA Democrat, Lawson served in the Florida Legislature for 28 years, rising to the rank of \"Dean of the Senate\" prior to his election to the U.S. House of Representatives. From 2000 to 2010, Lawson served Florida Senate, representing the 6th District, where he was elected to serve as the Democratic Leader. From 1982 to 2000, he was a member of the Florida House of Representatives.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nLawson was born in Midway, Florida, and attended Havana Northside High School where he was a standout athlete in basketball and track. He went on to become a basketball star at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU), where he earned a bachelor's degree in political science.  After a brief stint as a professional basketball player with the Indiana Pacers and Atlanta Hawks, Lawson returned to Tallahassee where he landed a job at Florida State University as an assistant basketball coach where he helped take the Seminoles to the Elite Eight. Lawson also earned his Master of Public Administration from Florida State University.\n\n\n== Campaigns for the U.S. House ==\n\n\n=== 2010 ===\n\nLawson ran for the Democratic nomination in Florida's 2nd congressional district in 2010, challenging seven-term incumbent Allen Boyd. Lawson narrowly lost to Boyd in the Democratic primary, and Boyd lost to Republican newcomer Steve Southerland in the general election by more than 12 percentage points.\n\n\n=== 2012 ===\n\nLawson ran again for the seat in 2012, and won the Democratic nomination against Blue Dog-endorsed state Rep. Leonard Bembry. He lost to incumbent Republican nominee Steve Southerland in the general election by less than 6 points.\n\n\n=== 2016 ===\n\nA lawsuit challenging the Florida congressional district map radically changed the 5th district.  For the past quarter century, the district and its predecessors had covered most of the majority-black precincts from Jacksonville to Orlando.  The new map, however, changed the district to an east-west configuration stretching from Tallahassee to downtown Jacksonville. The redrawn district included Lawson's home in Tallahassee, and Lawson announced he would run for the 5th on December 15, 2015, setting up a battle against Corrine Brown, the only congresswoman the district had known since its creation in 1993.On paper, the district's demographics appeared to be against Lawson.  While the district now included most of Tallahassee, the capital and its suburbs only accounted for 32 percent of the district's population, while the Jacksonville area accounted for 61 percent.\nHowever, his bid received a significant boost in July 2016, when Brown was indicted on federal corruption charges. He defeated Brown in the Democratic primary\u2014the real contest in this heavily Democratic district\u2014on August 30, 2016.  He then defeated Republican Glo Smith in the general election on November 8 with 64% of the vote.\n\n\n== U.S. House of Representatives ==\n\n\n=== Tenure ===\nRep. Lawson was sworn in on January 3, 2017.\n\n\n=== Committee assignments ===\nCommittee on Agriculture\nSubcommittee on Nutrition\nSubcommittee on General Farm Commodities and Risk Management\nSubcommittee on Biotechnology, Horticulture, and Research\nCommittee on Small Business\nSubcommittee on Agriculture, Energy and Trade\nSubcommittee on Health and Technology (Ranking Member)\n\n\n=== Caucus memberships ===\nCongressional Black Caucus\n\n\n== Political positions ==\n\n\n=== Gun law ===\nFollowing the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, Lawson expressed frustration with the lack of action on gun regulation and placed blame on lobbying organizations, saying \"the stranglehold of the gun lobby has gone on long enough\".\nLawson supports restriction on assault weapons.\nIn 2017, Lawson voted no on the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017, which would require all states to recognize concealed carry permits issued in other states. Additionally, those with concealed carry permits would be permitted to carry concealed weapons in school zones.\nLawson also voted no on the Veterans Second Amendment Protection Act, which would have allowed veterans who are considered \"mentally incompetent\" to purchase ammunition and firearms unless declared a danger by a judge.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of African-American United States Representatives\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCongressman Al Lawson official U.S. House website\nCampaign website\nAl Lawson at Curlie (based on DMOZ)\n\nBiography at the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress\nProfile at Vote Smart\nFinancial information (federal office) at the Federal Election Commission\nLegislation sponsored at the Library of Congress\nAppearances on C-SPAN"}}},"limits":{"extracts":20}}
