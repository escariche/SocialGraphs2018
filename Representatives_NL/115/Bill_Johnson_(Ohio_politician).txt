While Pruitt was being grilled, largely along party lines, during an April 2018 hearing about the ethics concerns, Johnson said, \"I think it's shameful today that this hearing has turned into a personal attack hearing and a shameful attempt to denigrate the work that's being done at the EPA and with this administration\".
