Located in central Kentucky, the district covers Fort Knox, Owensboro, Bowling Green and Danville. He has served in that role since 2009. He is a member of the Republican Party. He previously served in the Kentucky Senate.\n\n\n== Early life, education, and career ==\nGuthrie was born in Florence, Alabama, the son of Carolyn P. (n\u00e9e Holt) and Lowell M. Guthrie. He earned his Bachelor of Science in mathematical economics from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1987 and his Master's of Public and Private Management from Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1997.\nGuthrie is a former vice president of Trace Die Cast, Inc., an automotive parts supplier based in Bowling Green. Guthrie has previously served as a field artillery officer in the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.\n\n\n== Kentucky Senate ==\nGuthrie represented the 32nd district in the Kentucky Senate from 1999 to 2008, where he served as vice chairman of the Economic Development, Tourism and Labor Committee, and was chairman of the Transportation Committee.\n\n\n== U.S. House of Representatives ==\n\n\n=== Elections ===\n2008\nIn the 2008 congressional general election, he defeated his Democratic opponent, State Senator David Boswell, for the right to succeed the retiring Republican U.S. Representative Ron Lewis. Lewis announced his retirement on the last day for candidates to file for the seat in 2008, in hopes of steering the Republican nomination to his chief of staff, Daniel London. Guthrie, however, filed his papers and defeated London for the party nomination.\nThis set up the closest race in the 2nd in 14 years.  While Democrats have a large advantage in registration, the voters are very conservative on social issues.  This was a major reason Lewis had been able to hold on to the district with little trouble since winning it in a 1994 special election.  Ultimately, Guthrie prevailed by 15,500 votes, mostly on the strength of rural voters. Guthrie may have been boosted by voters being more motivated to come to the polls due to the Presidential election and the Senate election that were held at the same time. Republican candidate John McCain carried the district with 60 percent of the vote and won all but one county entirely within the district. The incumbent Republican Senator Mitch McConnell also carried the 2nd district easily.\n\n2010\nThe 2nd reverted to form in 2010, and Guthrie defeated Democrat Ed Marksberry by a large margin.\n\n2012\nGuthrie won reelection in 2012 with over 64% of the vote.\n\n2018\nGuthrie filed for re-election on November 27, 2017. Two Democratic challengers have filed against Guthrie: Grant Short and Brian Pedigo.\n\n\n=== Tenure ===\n2011In 2011, Guthrie voted for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial. In July 2013, Guthrie voted against the move to defund the National Security Agency due to the alleged privacy violations reported by whistleblower Edward Snowden.\n2013Guthrie voted in favor to end the United States federal government shutdown of 2013.In September, Guthrie introduced the Missing Children's Assistance Reauthorization Act of 2013, authorizing the continued funding of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children through fiscal year 2018 and to strengthen additional programs that prevent the abduction and sexual exploitation of children.\n2017Guthrie introduced, alongside Virginia Foxx, the Promoting Real Opportunity, Success and Prosperity through Education Reform (PROSPER) Act, an act that would eliminate Public Service Loan Forgiveness and would reduce federal funding made available to for-profit colleges.On December 19, Guthrie voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Prior to his vote, Guthrie said that he was \"willing to accept\" criticism about the bill making American businesses more competitive on a global scale.\n\n\n=== Committee assignments ===\nCommittee on Energy and Commerce\nSubcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection\nSubcommittee on Communications and Technology\nSubcommittee on Health\nCommittee on Education and the Workforce\nSubcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor and Pensions\nSubcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training\n\n\n=== Caucus memberships ===\nCongressional Arts Caucus\nRepublican Study Committee\nClimate Solutions Caucus\n\n\n== Political positions ==\n\n\n=== Domestic issues ===\n\n\n==== Gun law ====\nGuthrie has an \"A\" rating from the National Rifle Association (\"NRA\") for his pro-gun rights voting history.\n\n\n==== Health care ====\nGuthrie supports the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\").\n\n\n=== Social issues ===\n\n\n==== Abortion ====\nGuthrie is pro-life.
