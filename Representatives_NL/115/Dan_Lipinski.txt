He is a member of the Democratic Party. The district includes much of the southwest side of Chicago, along with several nearby suburbs. Lipinski is also a member of the Blue Dog Coalition and is known as a conservative and pro-life Democrat.\n\n\n== Early life, education, and career ==\nLipinski was born in Chicago, and is the son of Rose Marie (n\u00e9e Lapinski) and former U.S. Congressman Bill Lipinski. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree from Northwestern University in mechanical engineering (earned in 1988), a Master of Science degree from Stanford University (1989) in engineering-economic systems, and a Ph.D. in political science from Duke University (1998).\nDuring the summer of 1992, he interned at the United States Department of Labor. He served in that same capacity for U.S. Congressman George E. Sangmeister from 1993 to 1995. From 1995 to 1996, Lipinski was a legislative staff member for U.S. Congressman Jerry Costello. He then served on Cook County State's Attorney Richard A. Devine's campaign during the 1996 election season, and later on Devine's transition staff. After a short stint on then-U.S. Congressman Rod Blagojevich's staff, Lipinski served as a communication staff aide to then-House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt.\nFrom 2000 to 2001, Lipinski taught at the University of Notre Dame. In 2001, he joined the faculty of the University of Tennessee, where he remained until his election to Congress in 2004.\n\n\n== U.S. House of Representatives ==\nIn 2004, Lipinski's father ran for re-nomination in the Democratic primary. After easily winning the nomination, the elder Lipinski announced his retirement. As the Democratic committeeman for Chicago's 23rd Ward\u2014which is virtually coextensive with the Chicago portion of the 3rd\u2014he was able to persuade the state Democratic Party to select his son to replace him on the ballot. The move was somewhat controversial; not only had the younger Lipinski not lived regularly in Illinois since 1989 and never run for elected office before, but it allowed him to sidestep the Democratic primary\u2014the real contest in this heavily Democratic district. As expected, Lipinski defeated his Republican challenger, Ryan Chlada, in the general election.\nIn the 2006 Democratic primary Lipinski won 55% of the vote against two opponents, and in the general election he defeated the Republican nominee, Raymond Wardingley, with 77% of the vote. Lipinski defeated three opponents in the 2008 Democratic primary and beat Republican Michael Hawkins in the general election with 73% of the vote. In the 2010 general election Lipinski faced Republican Michael Bendas, and once again won with over 70% of the vote.Lipinski faced Marie Newman in the 2018 Democratic primary and defeated her with 51.2% of the vote, to Newman's 48.8% of the vote.\n\n\n=== Committee assignments ===\nLipinski serves on two House Committees: Transportation & Infrastructure and Science, Space, & Technology. He is the most senior member from Illinois on the Transportation & Infrastructure Committee, serving on the Subcommittee on Aviation and the Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials. On the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Lipinski is the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Research and sits on the Subcommittee on Energy. His district includes Argonne National Laboratory, the first national laboratory in the United States and the largest facility of its kind in the Midwest.\n\nCommittee on Science, Space & Technology\nSubcommittee on Research & Technology (Ranking Member)\nSubcommittee on Energy\nCommittee on Transportation & Infrastructure\nSubcommittee on Aviation\nSubcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, & Hazardous Materials\nSubcommittee on Highways and Transit\n\n\n=== Caucus memberships ===\nBlue Dog Coalition\nCongressional Arts Caucus\nAfterschool Caucuses\nCongressional Buy American Caucus (Founder and co-chair)\nBi-partisan Congressional Pro-life Caucus (Co-chair)\nBlue Collar Caucus\nUnited States Congressional International Conservation Caucus\nVeterinary Medicine Caucus\nClimate Solutions Caucus\n\n\n== Political positions ==\nLipinski is one of the most conservative Democrats in Congress; his district has been described as largely liberal. Lipinski has repeatedly argued that the Democratic Party is moving too far to the left, arguing that Democrats' alleged turn to the left helped Donald Trump to become president.\n\n\n=== Abortion and stem cell research ===\nLipinski is pro-life and serves as co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Pro-Life Caucus. He is a co-sponsor of the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act. In June 2013, Lipinski was one of only six Democrats in Congress who voted for a nationwide 20-week abortion ban.In 2007, Lipinski voted against legislation to increase funding for embryonic stem cell research.\n\n\n=== Barack Obama ===\nLipinski did not endorse President Barack Obama for reelection in 2012.\n\n\n=== Economy ===\nLipinski introduced the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act on June 12, 2012. The bill would require the government to implement policies that support manufacturing products that qualify for the \"Made in U.S.A.\" label, such as the establishment of a Manufacturing Strategy Board within the Commerce Department that includes federal officials, two state governors from different parties, and nine private-sector leaders and stakeholders from the manufacturing industry. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the bill on September 12, 2012, by a 339\u201377 vote.Lipinski has proposed what he calls a \"Five-Point Jobs Plan\". According to Lipinski, the plan would \"strengthen manufacturing, modernize our infrastructure, educate the workforce, force other countries to trade fairly and invest in innovation.\"\n\n\n=== Foreign policy and national security ===\nAfter the 2014 Hong Kong class boycott campaign and Umbrella Movement broke out, Lipinski joined Senator Sherrod Brown's and Representative Chris Smith's effort to introduce the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which would update the United States\u2013Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992. He expressed support for Hong Kong's autonomy and the pro-democracy protests, saying, \"conducting free and fair elections by universal suffrage is a guarantee that China itself made to Hong Kong. Any effort to end these demonstrations with aggressive force or disrupt the unique government structure that exists between China and Hong Kong will have a serious impact on China's relationship with the many nations of this world that stand for democracy and freedom.\"Lipinski supports strong counter-terrorism and domestic surveillance laws. He voted for the Patriot Act re-authorization of 2006, the Protect America Act of 2007, the FISA Amendment act of 2008, the Patriot Act Extension of 2011, and the FISA Extension of 2012. He voted against the Amash Amendment to the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act. Lipinski is one of only two Democratic lawmakers to have supported counter-terrorism and domestic surveillance laws to that extent.\n\n\n=== Healthcare ===\nLipinski was the only Illinois Democrat in Congress to oppose the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), which passed the House on March 21, 2010. He said that he broke ranks with his party for a number of reasons, including the bill's provisions related to abortion.\nLipinski had previously voted for a version of the bill that contained more stringent restrictions on abortion funding. In 2017, Lipinski said that he was trying to prevent Republicans from repealing Obamacare.In October 2013, Lipinski was the primary sponsor of HR3425, which would have delayed any penalties under the PPACA until four months after the program's website was fully functional.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn 2018, while facing a strong primary challenge, Lipinski expressed support for creating a pathway to citizenship for DREAMers (undocumented immigrants who were brought into the United States as minors). Previously, he voted against the DREAM Act, which would have created a pathway to citizenship for those individuals.\n\n\n=== LGBT rights ===\nLipinski opposed recognition of same-sex marriage until the Supreme Court legalized it nationwide in Obergefell v. Hodges. In 2011, he supported the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which denied federal benefits to gay couples. The portion of DOMA that prohibited gay marriage was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2013; by 2015, Lipinski had not publicly changed his support for DOMA. Lipinski voted against the Equality Act, which would have expanded protections against LGBT discrimination. Lipinski supported the First Amendment Defense Act, which would prohibit the federal government from requiring that some businesses not discriminate against homosexual couples. In 2009, Lipinski voted for the Hate Crimes Expansion bill, which expands the definition of hate crime and strengthens enforcement of hate-crime laws. In 2010, he voted in favor of repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell.Lipinski now says he personally opposes same-sex marriage but supports the status quo \"because it has been declared the law of the land.\" In 2016, he supported the Republican version of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which sought to allow businesses not to follow some gay rights mandates.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBefore serving in Congress, Lipinski taught American Government at a number of colleges, including the University of Notre Dame. He also gained experience on Capitol Hill working for the House Administration Committee, the Democratic Policy Committee, and House members, including Minority Leader Richard Gephardt. Lipinski has also worked for the U.S. Department of Labor and the Illinois General Assembly's Commission on Intergovernmental Cooperation.\nLipinski earned a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Northwestern University, a master's degree in engineering-economic systems from Stanford University, and a Ph.D. in political science from Duke University. He is one of only a dozen trained engineers in the 113th Congress.\nLipinski and his wife, Judy, reside in Western Springs, Illinois. In their free time, they are avid runners, participating in numerous races each year, from two-mile sprints to half-marathons.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCongressman Daniel Lipinski official U.S. House site\nDan Lipinski for Congress\nDan Lipinski at Curlie (based on DMOZ)\n\nBiography at the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress\nProfile at Vote Smart\nFinancial information (federal office) at the Federal Election Commission\nLegislation sponsored at the Library of Congress"}}},"limits":{"extracts":20}}
