He is a member of the Democratic Party. The district includes Davenport, Pella, Iowa City, Clinton, and Ottumwa. He is an Emeritus Professor of political science at Cornell College. He is currently the only Democrat in Iowa's congressional delegation.\n\n\n== Early life, education and career ==\nLoebsack was born in Sioux City, Iowa and was raised in a single parent household of limited financial means. He graduated from East High School and attended college at Iowa State University. There, Loebsack earned both a Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts in political science.\nAfter receiving a Doctor of Philosophy from the University of California, Davis, Loebsack took a job as a political science professor at Cornell College, a small liberal arts college in Mount Vernon, near Cedar Rapids. Today, he serves as a professor emeritus. Loebsack started the Linn Phoenix group, a fundraising arm of the Linn County Democrats.\n\n\n== U.S. House of Representatives ==\n\n\n=== Committee assignments ===\nCommittee on Armed ServicesSubcommittee on Military Personnel\nSubcommittee on Readiness\nCommittee on Education and the WorkforceSubcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training\nSubcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions\n\n\n=== Caucus memberships ===\nCongressional Cement Caucus\nCongressional Progressive Caucus\nCongressional Arts Caucus\nAfterschool Caucuses\n\n\n== Voting record ==\nConsistently, David Loebsack has voted in line with the Democratic Party.

Regarding civil liberties and civil rights, Loebsack has received 91% from the Human Rights Campaign (2009\u20132010), 95% from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (2009\u20132010), and 20% from the Arab American Institute (2009\u20132010). Loebsack has generally scored high among Interest Groups involved in civil liberties.\n\n\n==== Environment ====\nConcerning the Environment, he received 94% from the League of Conservation Voters (2011) and 90% from Environment America (2011).\n\n\n==== Abortion ====\nFinally, his Interest Group Ratings concerning abortion reflect the Democratic party position, predictably receiving 100% from NARAL Pro-Choice America (2011) and 0% from the National Right to Life Committee (2011).\n\n\n== Political campaigns ==\n\n\n=== 2006 ===\nIn 2006 Loebsack defeated 15-term incumbent Jim Leach in one of the biggest upsets of the cycle. Loebsack was nominated by a special convention of the 2nd District after failing to get the required number of signatures to be on the primary ballot. Since there was no one qualified for the ballot, the convention was called to determine the nomination.  The 2nd had been trending Democratic for some time (a Republican presidential candidate hasn't carried it since 1984), and was reckoned as the most Democratic district in the state.  It was taken for granted that Leach would have been succeeded by a Democrat once he retired.  Nonetheless, Leach was not on any Democratic target lists.  Loebsack won largely by running up an 8,395-vote margin in Johnson County, home to Iowa City.\n\n\n=== 2008 ===\nLoebsack was easily reelected in 2008, taking 57 percent of the vote over Mariannette Miller-Meeks, a doctor from Ottumwa and the former president of the state medical society.\n\n\n=== 2010 ===\n\nLoebsack faced Miller-Meeks again in 2010 and had a much more difficult time of it than he had two years earlier. He prevailed with only 51% of the vote, largely by running up a 13,900-vote margin in Johnson County. Terry Branstad easily carried the district in his successful bid to reclaim the governorship. Chuck Grassley carried every county in the district except Johnson; in fact, Johnson was the only county Grassley lost in his bid for another term.\n\n\n=== 2012 ===\nAfter redistricting moved Loebsack's home in Mount Vernon to the 1st District of fellow Democrat Bruce Braley, Loebsack moved to Iowa City in the reconfigured 2nd.  The redrawn district is no less Democratic than its predecessor; it regained Davenport, which had been the anchor of the 2nd and its predecessors for decades before being shifted out of the district in the 2000s round of redistricting.\nLoebsack won the election with 55.4% of the vote. His Republican opponent, John Archer, got 42.5%; Alan Aversa, an Independent candidate, received 2.2%. Braley won the 1st district with 56.9% of the vote.\n\n\n=== 2014 ===\nLoebsack beat Miller-Meeks, 52.5% to 47.5%. The 1st district went Republican, leaving Loebsack the only Democratic House member from Iowa.\n\n\n=== 2016 ===\nIn October 2016, the Daily Iowan endorsed Loebsack, saying that while he was \"not perfect\" he displayed a \"willingness to work with the other side\" and had \"maintained some degree of competence in office.\" Loebsack beat Christopher Peters, 54% to 46%. Again, Loebsack was the only Democrat that Iowa sent to the House in 2016. The state went for Donald Trump by a comfortable margin, and Republican Chuck Grassley was returned to the Senate by a landslide. Despite the Republican swing in Iowa, Loebsack managed to hold his position as a Democrat.\n\n\n== Tenure ==\n\n\n=== Taxation ===\nIn November 2017, Loebsack was the only House member from Iowa to vote against tax reform, claiming the \"tax plan that was rushed through the House of Representatives will hurt everyday Iowans.\"\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nIn September 2017, Loebsack told Ottumwa voters that he supports \"Dreamers.\" He said, \"We've got do everything we can to protect them.\"\n\n\n== Electoral history ==\n\n\n=== 2006 ===\n\n\n=== 2008 ===\n\n\n=== 2010 ===\n\n\n=== 2012 ===\n\n\n=== 2014 ===\n\n\n=== 2016 ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nU.S. Congressman Dave Loebsack official U.S. House site\nDave Loebsack for Congress\nDave Loebsack at Curlie (based on DMOZ)\n\nBiography at the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress\nProfile at Vote Smart\nFinancial information (federal office) at the Federal Election Commission\nLegislation sponsored at the Library of Congress"}}},"limits":{"extracts":20}}
