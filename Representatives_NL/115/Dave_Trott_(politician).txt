Both the Michigan Chamber of Commerce and the United States Chamber of Commerce endorsed Trott's campaign, joining more than 350 other individuals and elected officials.On May 27 MIRS \u2013 Michigan Information and Research Service published the results of an initial Republican primary poll for the 11th Congressional District which showed incumbent Kerry Bentivolio at 33% to Trott's 21%, with a large portion of the district undecided.Trott enjoyed a significant advantage in resources over his opponent throughout the campaign, with more than $1 million in the bank following the first quarter of 2014, compared to Bentivolio's $130,000. According to Federal Election Campaign filings Trott had personally contributed over $2,400,000 to his own primary run and outspent the incumbent approximately 20:1. The congressional primary election was held on August 5, 2014 in which he defeated Bentivolio.

He publicly called President Donald Trump \"unhelpful on health care.\"\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nFollowing the inauguration of Donald Trump in January 2017, Trott was increasingly criticized for not holding a town hall since April 2015. In response, he held a \u201cTele-Town Hall\u201d on February 7, 2017, which received mixed reviews as some accused Trott of 'cherry-picking' questions over the phone. In addition, over 150 individuals who signed up for the Tele-Town Hall ultimately never received a call to participate. No explanation or apology was provided for the exclusion. During the congressional recess of 2017, individual constituents of Trott's District, Michigan  District 11, organized two separate Town Halls in hopes of enticing Trott to attend. Instead of meeting with his constituents, Trott chose to travel to India. Trott's office was not forthcoming with his schedule, and constituents found out about his trip via a story in the India Times just days before the first of the two Town Halls.After the congressional recess, constituents continued to encourage Trott to hold a town hall meeting where they could meet with their representative face-to-face. In some cases, constituents were turned away at the door of Trott's office and police were called to remove them. Then, on March 18, 2017, Trott held a town hall meeting with a mixed crowd, admitting his supporters a full half hour before the general public and seating them in the first rows of the audience. The majority of the general public were those opposed to Trott. Despite the event being held at a large convention venue, seating for only approximately 250 was provided. The vast majority of the approximately 1,000 constituents who arrived were not admitted to the town hall due to space limitations, and many stayed throughout in protest through a very heavy snowfall.\nTopics discussed included the repeal and replacement of the ACA funding for social programs, and whether Trump\u2019s tweets were a good strategy. After the town-hall meeting, Trott and his aide, Stu Sandler, were caught on a hot mic stating \u201cWe\u2019re going to take that part where they\u2019re booing funding for the military and I\u2019m going to get somebody to write a story and we\u2019re going to promote the sh*t out of that\u201d, adding \u201cIt\u2019s un-American crap.\u201d An aide was also heard stating that they had \u201cbounced\u201d certain questions they did not want Trott to answer. Review of the tape shows that the booing begins after Trott said the American military was \u201cthe weakest it\u2019s ever been\u201d rather than related to military funding.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCongressman Dave Trott official U.S. House website\nDave Trott for Congress\nDave Trott at Curlie (based on DMOZ)\nAppearances on C-SPAN\n\nBiography at the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress\nProfile at Vote Smart\nFinancial information (federal office) at the Federal Election Commission\nLegislation sponsored at the Library of Congress"}}},"limits":{"extracts":20}}
