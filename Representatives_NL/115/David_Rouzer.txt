His home in Johnston County had been drawn into the district; it had previously been in the 2nd District.\nIn the Republican primary, Rouzer defeated both 2010 nominee Ilario Pantano and Randy Crow, but won just four of the district's twelve counties: Johnston (82%), Sampson (49%), Lenoir (43%), and Hoke (38%).  However, his margin in Johnston County, the second-largest county in the reconfigured district, was enough for him to win.\nThe redrawn 7th is much more conservative and Republican than its predecessor. Roll Call rates the election as leans Republican.After an official tabulation showed that Rouzer had lost the election to McIntyre by 655 votes, Rouzer asked for a recount on November 21, 2012. After the recount, Rouzer conceded the race to McIntyre on November 28.  It was the closest House race in the country. Mitt Romney carried the district with 56 percent of the vote.\n\n\n== 2014 congressional election ==\nRouzer ran for the 7th district again in 2014. McIntyre retired rather than face a rematch.  Most pundits believed that with McIntyre's retirement, the seat would be an easy GOP pickup.  Even before his near-miss in 2012, the 7th had been trending Republican for some time.\nRouzer won the general election with almost 60% of the vote.  Upon taking office in January 2015, he became only the second Republican to represent a significant portion of eastern North Carolina in the House since Reconstruction.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCongressman David Rouzer official House website\nDavid Rouzer for Congress\nDavid Rouzer at Curlie (based on DMOZ)\nAppearances on C-SPAN\n\nBiography at the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress\nProfile at Vote Smart\nFinancial information (federal office) at the Federal Election Commission\nLegislation sponsored at the Library of Congress"}}},"limits":{"extracts":20}}
