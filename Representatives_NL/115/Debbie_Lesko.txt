She previously served as a member of the Arizona Senate from 2015 to 2018, representing the state's 21st district. She also was President pro tempore of the Arizona Senate from 2017 to 2018. Lesko also served as a member of Arizona House of Representatives from 2009 until 2015. \nLesko won the Republican nomination for Arizona's 8th congressional district special election to replace Trent Franks, who resigned from Congress, on February 27, 2018. She won the election on April 24, defeating Democratic nominee Hiral Tipirneni with 52.4% of the vote to Tipirneni's 47.6%.\n\n\n== U.S. House of Representatives ==\n\n\n=== 2018 special election ===\n\nDebbie Lesko was the Republican nominee for the special election held to replace Congressman Trent Franks, who resigned amid allegations of sexual harassment. She faced the Democratic candidate, physician Hiral Tipirneni, in the general election on April 24. She was endorsed by President Donald Trump who said that Lesko was a \"conservative Republican\". It was the closest contest in what is now the 8th since 1976, when Bob Stump won what was then the 3rd District with just 47 percent of the vote (the district was renumbered as the 2nd in 2003, and has been the 8th since 2013).\nShe won the election on April 24, beating Democrat Hiral Tipirneni with 52.6% of the vote to Tipirneni's 47.4. The win was by a narrower margin than expected, with observers suggesting that it was indicative of a coming Democratic wave in the 2018 mid-term elections. According to the Associated Press, the election sent \"a big message to Republicans nationwide: Even the reddest of districts in a red state can be in play this year.\"\n\n\n==== Campaign finance complaints ====\nIn January 2018, Lesko's campaign committee, Re-elect Debbie Lesko for Senate, gave $50,000 to Conservative Leadership for Arizona, a federal PAC authorized to spend independently of other campaigns. It was created eight days before taking the money from Lesko's state campaign committee. The new PAC raised almost no other cash, records show, and the PAC used the money to support Lesko with yard signs, while her congressional campaign spent heavily on TV ads. Phil Lovas, a candidate in the Republican primary, complained to the Federal Election Commission and Arizona Attorney General alleging multiple violations in February 2018.The PAC maneuver also prompted criticism from the other Lesko opponent in the Republican primary, Steve Montenegro, who accused Lesko of \"illegally funneling money into her SuperPAC and knowingly lied about it by filing false campaign reports.\" A second complaint alleging federal campaign finance law violations was filed against Lesko in March 2018 by the Campaign Legal Center alleging that her transfer of $50,000 from her state campaign to an independent group that spent nearly all the cash backing her congressional run was illegal.\n\n\n=== Committee assignments ===\nCommittee on Homeland Security\nSubcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications\nSubcommittee on Transportation and Protective Security\nCommittee on Science, Space, and Technology\nSubcommittee on Research and Technology\nSubcommittee on Environment\n\n\n== Political positions ==\n\n\n=== Economy, taxes and regulation ===\nLesko has said that she would have voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the Republican Party's 2017 tax overhaul.

After a long pause, she said that the question was \"loaded\" and added, \"Is some of it, maybe, human-caused? Possibly. But certainly not the majority of it. I think it just goes through cycles and it has to do a lot with the sun. So no, I'm not a global warming proponent.\"In 2016, Lesko crafted a measure that would gave state utilities in Arizona the right to charge separate rates for customers who produced their own energy through solar panels. Lesko crafted the measure with the assistance of utilities.\n\n\n=== Health care ===\nLesko has said she opposes \"universal health coverage\" and favors repealing the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). She opposed Arizona's expansion of Medicaid coverage and sued former Arizona governor Jan Brewer after she expanded Medicaid.\n\n\n=== Immigration ===\nDuring her 2018 campaign, Lesko made the construction of a border wall on the Mexico border the centerpiece of her campaign, and she pledged to back the Trump administration's hardline positions on border security and immigration reform.\n\n\n=== Social issues ===\nLesko is pro-life. She has proposed legislation to give employers religious exemptions from providing contraceptives in health insurance plans.
