Former Colorado House Speaker Terrance Carroll, an African-American, replied, \u201cLooking beyond the fact that Congressman Lamborn's entire comment is nonsensical, his use of the term 'tar baby' is unfortunate because [of] the historical connotation of that term when used in conjunction with African Americans.\"On August 1, 2011, Lamborn apologized for his use of the slur, \"When I said 'tar baby', I was talking economic quagmire that our country is finding ourselves in because of poor economic policy from the White House.
