He graduated with honors from the Baltimore City College high school in 1969. He later attended Howard University in Washington, D.C., where he served in the student government as sophomore class president, student government treasurer and later student government president. He became a member of the Phi Beta Kappa Society and graduated in 1973 with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science.\nCummings graduated from law school at the University of Maryland School of Law, receiving his J.D. in 1976.  He was admitted to the Maryland Bar in December 1976. He practiced law for 19 years before first being elected to the House in the 1996 elections.\nAlso after graduating from law school, Cummings received 12 honorary doctoral degrees from different universities across America, most recently an honorary doctorate of public service from the University of Maryland, College Park in 2017.For 14 years, Cummings served in the Maryland House of Delegates. His predecessor, Lena King Lee, raised funds and campaigned for him; years later, Cummings credited her with launching his political career. In the Maryland General Assembly, he served as Chairman of the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland and was the first Black man in Maryland history to be named Speaker Pro Tempore, the second highest position in the House of Delegates.\nCummings also serves on many different boards and commissions both inside and outside of Baltimore City. Some of those include SEED Schools of Maryland Board of Directors and the University of Maryland Board of Advisors.

Reportedly, Towns withdrew because of a lack of support from Nancy Pelosi who feared that he would not be a sufficiently aggressive leader of Democrats in an anticipated struggle with incoming committee chair Republican Darrell Issa.\nReportedly, the White House also wanted Towns to be replaced. Cummings defeated Carolyn Maloney in a vote of the House Democratic Caucus.\n\n\n=== Caucus memberships ===\nTask Force on Health Care Reform\nCo-founder and Chairman of the Congressional Caucus on Drug Policy\nCongressional Arts Caucus\nAfterschool CaucusesCummings is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. He served as Chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus during the 108th United States Congress.\nCummings received praise and a boost in notoriety following the Congressional panel hearings on steroids in March 2005. While investigating the use of steroids in sports, the panel called numerous baseball players to testify, including former single season home run record holder Mark McGwire. After McGwire answered many questions in a vague fashion, Cummings demanded to know if he was \"taking the Fifth\", referring to the Fifth Amendment. McGwire responded by saying, \"I am here to talk about the future, not about the past.\"  The exchange came to epitomize the entire inquiry.\n\n\n=== Legislation ===\nCummings introduced the Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014, a bipartisan bill signed into law by President Barack Obama in December 2014.  The bill, which Cummings cosponsored with Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California, is a set of amendments to the Federal Records Act and Presidential Records Act. Among other provisions, the bill modernizes the definition of a federal record to expressly include electronic documents.Cummings supported the Smart Savings Act, a bill that would make the default investment in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) an age-appropriate target date asset allocation investment fund (L Fund) instead of the Government Securities Investment Fund (G Fund). Cummings called the bill a \"commonsense change\" and argued that the bill \"will enable workers to take full advantage of a diversified fund designed to yield higher returns\".Cummings introduced the All Circuit Review Extension Act, a bill that would extend for three years the authority for federal employees who appeal a judgment of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) to file their appeal at any federal court, instead of only the U.S. Court of Appeals. Cummings said that this program is important to extend because it \"allows whistleblowers to file appeals where they live rather than being limited to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals\". He also said that the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals has \"an abysmal track record in whistleblower cases\".In remarks at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, Cumming declared: \"Our party does not just believe, but understands, that Black Lives Matter. But we also recognize that our community and our law enforcement work best when they work together.\"\n\n\n== Political campaigns ==\n\nFive-term Congressman Kweisi Mfume resigned in February 1996 to take the presidency of the NAACP.
