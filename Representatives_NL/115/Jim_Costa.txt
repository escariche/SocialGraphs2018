He previously served in the California State Assembly from 1978 until 1994, and in the State Senate from 1994 until 2002. At the time of his election to the California State Legislature, he was the youngest member of the legislature at the age of 26. During his time in the California State Assembly, he served as the Majority Caucus Chair. California's 16th congressional district takes in large and predominantly Latino portions of Fresno.  Costa is chair of the Blue Dog Coalition and ranking member of the United States House Agriculture Subcommittee on Rural Development, Research, Biotechnology, and Foreign Agriculture.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBorn in Fresno, Costa is a third-generation family farmer. His grandparents emigrated from Portugal's Azores Islands in the early 20th century. He graduated from San Joaquin Memorial High School (1970) and from Fresno State (1974), where he was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon. He worked as a Special Assistant to Congressman John Krebs (1975\u201376), and as Administrative Assistant to Assemblyman Richard Lehman (1976\u201378).\n\n\n== California Legislature ==\nCosta represented part of Fresno County in the State Legislature for 24 years, serving in the California State Assembly (1978\u201394) and in the California State Senate (1994-2002). In 1986, he was cited for soliciting prostitution after being arrested with a 19-year-old prostitute to whom Costa paid $50. Calling the incident \"an error of judgement\", he pleaded no contest to the charge.\n\n\n== U.S. House of Representatives ==\n\n\n=== Committee assignments ===\nCommittee on Agriculture\nSubcommittee on Conservation, Energy, and Forestry\nSubcommittee on Rural Development, Research, Biotechnology, and Foreign Agriculture\nCommittee on Natural Resources\nSubcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources\nSubcommittee on Water and Power\n\n\n=== Caucus memberships ===\nAmerican Sikh Congressional Caucus\nBeef Caucus Specialty\nCongressional Organ Donation Caucus (Co-Founder)\nCongressional Soils Caucus\nCongressional Victims' Rights Caucus (Co-Founder and Co-Chair)\nCongressional Water Caucus (Co-Founder)\nUnited States Congressional International Conservation Caucus\nMethamphetamine Caucus\nNew Democrat Coalition\nCongressional Hispanic Caucus\nVeterinary Medicine Caucus\n\n\n=== Political campaigns ===\n2004In 2004, Costa entered the Democratic primary for the 20th district, which was opened up by the retirement of its seven-term incumbent, Cal Dooley. Dooley endorsed his chief of staff, Lisa Quigley, as his successor, but most of the state's Democratic Party establishment, including Senator Dianne Feinstein, endorsed Costa, who won the bruising primary and faced Republican Party state senator Roy Ashburn in November.The 20th district is a heavily Democratic, 63% Latino-majority district; it gave Al Gore his highest vote total outside the state's two large conurbations (Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay Area in the north and Los Angeles and San Diego to the south). Nonetheless, the Republicans spent a substantial amount of money on the race. Ashburn's campaign made plays on Costa's name, \"Costa's going to cost ya,\" and linked him to former Governor Gray Davis, calling them \"two taxing twins\". Costa won the election with 54% of the vote to Ashburn's 46%. Ashburn kept the margin within single digits by winning heavily Republican Kings County.\n\n2006Costa ran unopposed for reelection in 2006. The Democrats won control of the House in that election, and Costa became chairman of the Natural Resources Committee's Energy and Mineral Resources Subcommittee. He is a member of the House Agriculture Committee.\n2008Costa was reelected in 2008 with 74 percent of the vote, the highest percentage for a Democratic incumbent outside Sacramento, the Bay Area and Southern California.\n2010\nCosta was challenged for reelection by Republican nominee Andy Vidak. In his closest race yet, the race was officially called for Costa nearly three weeks after election day, with the unofficial final tally standing at 45,806 votes (51.8%) for Costa and 42,773 votes (48.2%) for Vidak.\n\n2012\nFor his first four terms, Costa represented a district including most of the majority-Latino portions of Fresno and Bakersfield. However, redistricting following the 2010 census renumbered his district as the 21st district and made it slightly more Republican. In February 2012, Costa officially announced that he would run in the newly formed 16th district, a much more compact district that included most of Fresno as well as most of Merced. While most of his old territory remained in the 21st, the new 16th absorbed most of the Fresno County portion of his old district, including his home.\nCosta faced Republican Brian Whelan in the general election. After the new districts were announced, it was reported that the NRCC considered Costa vulnerable to defeat. However, had it existed in 2008, Barack Obama would have carried it with 57 percent of the vote.In November 2011, the League of Conservation Voters ran a series of television ads in Costa's district criticizing his environmental record. Costa was reelected in 2012 with 54% of the vote.\n2014\nCosta faced an unexpectedly close race against Republican Johnny Tacherra, a dairyman from rural Fresno County. On election night, Tacherra led by 736 votes, a margin that grew to 1,772 votes a few days later. However, Tacherra's lead narrowed as counting continued, and Costa ultimately defeated him by 1,319 votes. While Tacherra carried the district's portions of Merced and Madera counties, Costa defeated him in Fresno County by 9,600 votes.\n2016\nOn June 7, 2016, Costa was the sole Democratic candidate in the 2016 \"top two\" primary, and was ahead on June 28, with 55.9%, 50,917 votes. He was expected to be paired once again in the general election with Republican Johnny Tacherra, who was in second place with 33.1%, 30,342 votes. The counting of ballots was finalized on June 30.\n\n\n== Political positions ==\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\nCosta was one of the sponsors for the bipartisan Agricultural Certainty for Reporting Emissions (ACRE) Act. The act would strip provisions from Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), which was responsible for ensuring cleanup of industrial toxic waste dumps, oil spills, and chemical tank explosions environmental regulations on farm land. If enacted, this act would reduce transparency by allowing the livestock industry to hide their waste storage and disposal methods. Another provision would make it easier for farmers to dump pesticides into waterways regulated under the Clean Water Act.\n\n\n=== District of Columbia rights ===\nIn May 2016, Costa was one of two Democrats who supported the unprecedented step of overturning a District of Columbia referendum. The measure, passed by a vast majority of D.C. voters, would allow the District to spend its own tax dollars without congressional approval.\n\n\n=== Health care ===\nCosta was reportedly a holdout vote on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, in March 2010. He ultimately voted in favor of the legislation. To gain Costa's vote, the House leadership reportedly promised Costa and Dennis Cardoza funding for a medical school for California's Central Valley.\n\n\n=== High-speed rail ===\nCosta has been an advocate of creating a high-speed rail system that would go up and down California as well as across the nation at speeds of 225 miles-per-hour. He has introduced many bills supporting these rails; so far, none have passed. Miller has compared rail projects to Eisenhower's highway expansion and pleaded to Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood and President Obama for help in with this project.In April 2008, Costa wrote a piece in Capitol Weekly calling for high-speed rail in California.\n\n\n=== Keystone XL Pipeline ===\nIn January 2015, Costa was one of the twenty-eight Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives who voted in favor of building the controversial Keystone XL pipeline.\n\n\n=== National cemetery burials ===\nIn December 2017, Costa introduced legislation to allow some Hmong- and Laotian-American veterans to be buried in U.S. national cemeteries. The legislation applies to Hmong and Laotian veterans who fought alongside the U.S. against North Vietnamese forces in the 1960s and 1970s. The bill, which does  not allow for burials at Arlington National Cemetery, applies only to veterans who pass away on or after the bill's enactment. The bill was enacted in March 2018 as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018.\n\n\n=== Syrian refugees ===\nCosta voted on November 19, 2015, for HR 4038, legislation that would effectively halt the resettlement of refugees from Syria and Iraq to the United States.\n\n\n== Honors ==\n Commander of the Order of Merit, Portugal (June 8, 1996)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCongressman Jim Costa official U.S. House site\nCampaign website\nJim Costa at Curlie (based on DMOZ)\nAppearances on C-SPAN\n\nBiography at the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress\nProfile at Vote Smart\nFinancial information (federal office) at the Federal Election Commission\nLegislation sponsored at the Library of Congress\nBiography at Ballotpedia"}}},"limits":{"extracts":20}}
