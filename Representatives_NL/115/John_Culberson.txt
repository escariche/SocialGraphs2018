On August 1, 2008, to protest the House going into summer recess without discussing a pending energy bill, Culberson and other House Republicans stayed to make speeches about the energy bill in question. The Democratic leadership in the House, which controls services in the chamber, responded by cutting the microphones and cameras. Culberson used social media services Twitter and Qik to provide a live account of the proceedings. Culberson later compared this episode to the Iranian government's crackdown against dissidents who used Twitter to protest a restriction on foreign media in June 2009.\n\n\n== U.S. House of Representatives ==\n\n\n=== Committee assignments ===\nCommittee on Appropriations\nSubcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (Chairman)\nSubcommittee on Homeland Security\nSubcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies\n\n\n=== Caucuses ===\nCongressional Caucus on Turkey and Turkish Americans\nCongressional Constitution Caucus\nRepublican Study Committee\nTea Party Caucus\nCongressional Constitution Caucus\n\n\n=== Elections ===\n2000Culberson won the Republican nomination for the 7th District in 2000 after 15-term incumbent Bill Archer announced his retirement.
