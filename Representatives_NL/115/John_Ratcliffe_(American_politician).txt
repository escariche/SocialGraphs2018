In the runoff primary election on May 27, 2014, Ratcliffe defeated 17-term incumbent Ralph Hall. Ratcliffe was unopposed in the general election on November 4 and was sworn in as a member of the 114th Congress on January 6, 2015. He was re-elected to a second term in 2016 with 88% of the vote, defeating Cody Wommack.\nIn Heritage Action's final scorecard for the 114th Congress, Ratcliffe was ranked as the most conservative Texas legislator in Congress and second most conservative legislator in the country.\n\n\n== Early life, education, and early career ==\nBorn in Mount Prospect, Illinois, northwest of Chicago, Ratcliffe was the youngest of six children; both of his parents were teachers. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1987 with a Bachelor of Arts in Government and International Studies, then attended law school at SMU in Dallas (now Dedman School of Law) and earned his Juris Doctor in 1989.Ratcliffe is board certified in civil trial law by the National Board of Trial Advocacy. He has served as adjunct professor of law at various law schools, including Dedman School of Law (SMU) and Texas Wesleyan University. Between 2004 and 2012, he was elected to four consecutive terms as mayor of Heath, Texas.\n\n\n== George W. Bush administration ==\n\nIn 2004, President George W. Bush appointed Ratcliffe to be Chief of Anti-Terrorism and National Security for the Eastern District of Texas in the Department of Justice. In 2007, he was appointed U.S. Attorney of the Eastern District of Texas. It covered 33,000 square miles (85,000 km2), including almost all of the 4th congressional district. He managed 100 federal prosecutors, 6 district offices, and a $912 million budget allocated by the Department of Justice.Following his public service, he went back into private law practice, becoming a partner with the John Ashcroft Law Firm. He served as an aide to Mitt Romney as part of a transition team established before the 2012 elections for vetting potential government appointees.\n\n\n== U.S. House of Representatives ==\n\n\n=== 2014 election ===\n\nRatcliffe decided to run in the Republican primary against 17-term incumbent Congressman Ralph Hall of the 4th district. At ninety-one, Hall was the oldest member of Congress and the oldest person ever to serve in the House of Representatives. The Dallas Morning News wrote that Ratcliffe was Hall's \"most serious political challenge in years.\" In a primary where Hall had begun to look increasingly vulnerable, Ratcliffe received the endorsement of the Dallas Morning News, which applauded Hall's long record of public service but cited Ratcliffe's \"impressive credentials\" and the need for \"new ideas and fresh energy.\"  No Democrat even filed, though the 4th is so heavily Republican that any Democratic candidate would have faced nearly impossible odds in any event.  With a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+25, it is the fifth most Republican district in Texas and tied for the 13th most Republican district in the nation.\nIn the March 4 primary, Ratcliffe finished second with 29 percent of the vote, behind Hall's 45 percent.  However, because Hall came up short of a majority, a runoff was forced on May 27. Ratcliffe was subsequently endorsed by the Tea Party Express, the Senate Conservatives Fund, and Club For Growth. Hall was endorsed by the National Rifle Association, former Congressman Ron Paul, former Congresswoman Michele Bachmann, and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee.In the May 27 runoff, Ratcliffe defeated Hall with 53 percent of the vote. Ratcliffe won eleven of the eighteen counties in the district, including the four largest (Grayson, Rockwall, Hunt, and Lamar).\n\nAlthough it is very rare in any event for a primary challenger to defeat a sitting congressman, Ratcliffe's victory was historic as it marked the first time that a sitting Republican congressman in Texas had been ousted in a primary.  Incumbents had previously been successful in all 257 attempts.  Hall's defeat was also the first by an incumbent member of Congress in the 2014 election cycle.  Ratcliffe was sworn in as a member of the 114th United States Congress on January 6, 2015. He is just the fourth person to represent the district since it was created in 1903, and the first freshman Republican to win it.\n\n\n=== 2016 election ===\nOn March 1, 2016 Ratcliffe easily defeated two primary challengers by earning 68 percent of the vote total. He finished 47 percentage points ahead of the second-place finisher. Once again, no Democrat even filed, all but assuring Ratcliffe of a second term. In the 2016 General Election, Ratcliffe held a Libertarian opponent to 12 percent of the ballots cast.\n\n\n=== Tenure ===\nRatcliffe serves on the Judiciary Committee, Homeland Security Committee, and Ethics Committee. He is also the Chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Cybersecurity.  He was named to the Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel.The Dallas Morning News said in April 2016 that \"Ratcliffe's first term in Washington proves that freshman lawmakers can be players of consequence in Congress.\"Ratcliffe's questioning of then FBI Director James Comey during a House Judiciary Committee hearing in September 2016 has become front and center in the debate about whether Comey's decision to not recommend charges against Clinton was predetermined. When Ratcliffe asked Comey in that hearing whether Comey made his decision to not recommend charges against Clinton before or after interviewing her, he responded \"after.\" That answer under oath potentially contradicts subsequent reports that Comey began drafting his exoneration memo before interviewing Clinton.Ratcliffe is a member of the Republican Study Committee and the Congressional NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus.\n\n\n== Political positions ==\n\n\n=== National security ===\nRatcliffe supported President Donald Trump's 2017 executive order to temporarily curtail immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries until better screening methods are devised. He stated, \"I applaud President Trump's actions to vamp up the vetting of refugees attempting to enter our country.\"\n\n\n=== Cybersecurity ===\nIn March 2014, Ratcliffe oversaw a congressional hearing, \"The Current State of DHS Private Sector Engagement for Cybersecurity\", that studied ways to get the private sector and the Department of Homeland Security to better cooperate to prevent terrorist activity. He secured testimony from various organizations: the Hitrust Alliance, Intel Security Group, Symantec, Palo Alto Networks, and New America's Open Technology Institute.\n\n\n=== Net neutrality ===\nIn December 2017, Ratcliffe signed a letter from Congress (along with 106 other members of Congress) to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai supporting his plan to repeal net neutrality ahead of the commission's vote.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nRatcliffe and his wife, Michele, reside with their two daughters in Heath, Texas.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFinal Report of the Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCongressman Ratcliffe official US House website\nJohn Ratcliffe for Congress\nJohn Ratcliffe at Curlie (based on DMOZ)\n\nBiography at the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress\nProfile at Vote Smart\nFinancial information (federal office) at the Federal Election Commission\nLegislation sponsored at the Library of Congress\nAppearances on C-SPAN"}}},"limits":{"extracts":20}}
