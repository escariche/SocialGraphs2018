He has served in the House since 1997. He is a member of the Republican Party.\n\n\n== Early life, education, and career ==\nShimkus is a lifelong resident of Collinsville, part of the Metro East portion of the St. Louis metropolitan area. He is the son of Kathleen N. (n\u00e9e Mondy) and Gene L. Shimkus. His paternal grandfather was of Lithuanian descent. While in the Army, he earned the Expert Infantry Badge, Ranger tab, and Parachutist Badge. He served overseas with the 54th Infantry Regiment in West Germany.He first ran for office in 1989, when he was elected a Collinsville Township trustee. A year later, he was elected as Madison County treasurer\u2014the first Republican elected to a countywide post in 10 years. In 1994, he became the first Republican to be re-elected as county treasurer in 60 years.\n\n\n== U.S. House of Representatives ==\n\n\n=== Record ===\nShimkus was a key leader in the effort to reform the Toxic Substances Control Act, which was amended in 2016 by the Lautenberg Chemical Safety Act. Shimkus voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\n\n\n=== Committee assignments ===\nCommittee on Energy and CommerceSubcommittee on Communications and Technology\nSubcommittee on Energy and Power\nSubcommittee on Environment and Economy (Chairman)\nSubcommittee on Health\nRepublican Study Committee\n\n\n=== Caucus memberships ===\nHouse Baltic Caucus\nCongressional NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus\n\n\n== Political positions ==\n\n\n=== Domestic issues ===\n\n\n==== Climate change ====\n\nOn March 25, 2009, in introductory remarks made to Christopher Monckton, 3rd Viscount Monckton of Brenchley, during a United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Environment hearing, he made the following statement regarding the role of carbon dioxide in global warming:\n\nIt's plant food ... So if we decrease the use of carbon dioxide, are we not taking away plant food from the atmosphere? ... So all our good intentions could be for naught. In fact, we could be doing just the opposite of what the people who want to save the world are saying.\nShimkus has quoted the Bible to allay concerns of global warming induced rise in sea levels, stating that God had promised mankind through Noah that the earth would never again be destroyed by a flood. He acknowledged that climate change is real, but questioned the benefit of spending taxpayer money on something that cannot be changed versus the changes that have been occurring forever. Specifically, Shimkus said, \"Now, do I believe in climate change? In my trip to Greenland, the answer is yes. The climate is changing. The question is more about the costs and benefits and trying to spend taxpayer dollars on something that you cannot stop versus the changes that have been occurring forever. That's the real debate.\"\n\n\n==== Food safety ====\nShimkus has been a proponent of legislation to increase the ability of the Food and Drug Administration to institute recalls of tainted foods. He has served as one of the chief Republican negotiators on the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, which was passed by Congress and signed by the president. Of the bill, he said: \"When you're talking about the health and safety of folks, if the FDA has enough evidence to make a declaration of recall, I think that most Americans would support the government having that authority.\"\n\n\n=== Keystone pipeline ===\nIn May 2013, Shimkus stated he would renew his support for the Keystone pipeline. The project would be an oil pipeline, bringing Canadian crude oil through the Midwest, including Illinois. As a supporter, he stated that he would rather see Canada as an energy partner than ship in oil from overseas.\n\n\n=== National security ===\nShimkus spoke positively of President Donald Trump's 2017 executive order to temporarily curtail immigration from specified countries until better screening methods are devised. He stated that \"This temporary halt will give Congress and the new Administration time to evaluate and improve the vetting process, and in the meantime gives Secretary Kelly authority to grant exceptions to the restrictions as needed. One of those exceptions must be to green card holders, who have already undergone extensive screening.\"\n\n\n=== Social issues ===\n\n\n==== 2006 Mark Foley scandal ====\n\nShimkus said \"that in late-2005 he learned\u2014through information passed along by Alexander's office\u2014about an e-mail exchange in which Foley asked about the youngster's well-being after Hurricane Katrina and requested a photograph.\"\n\n\n==== Cannabis ====\nShimkus has a \"D\" rating from NORML for his voting history regarding cannabis-related causes. Shimkus opposes veterans having access to medical marijuana if recommended by their Veterans Health Administration doctor and if it is legal for medicinal purposes in their state of residence.\n\n\n== Political campaigns ==\nIn 1992, while still serving as Madison County treasurer, he won the Republican nomination to run for the U.S. House seat in what was then the 20th District. He was defeated by 10-year Democratic incumbent Dick Durbin.\nFour years later, Durbin gave up the seat to make what would be a successful run for the United States Senate. Shimkus won a crowded six-way primary, and faced State Representative Jay C. Hoffman in a close general election, which Shimkus won by just over 1,200 votes.\nHe has only faced one credible Democratic opponent since his initial reelection, in 2002. That year, Illinois lost a district as a result of the 2000 census, and his district was merged with the 19th District of two-term Democratic representative David D. Phelps. The new district retained Phelps' district number, but geographically and demographically was much more Shimkus' district, as he retained 60% of his former territory. The campaign was very bitter, with both men accusing the other's staffers of stalking their families. Despite a Democratic wave that swept through most of the state, he was easily reelected.\nShimkus announced in September 2005, that he would run for reelection in 2008, despite making a pledge when first elected in 1996 not to stay in office for more than 12 years.\nWhen seeking his 11th term in 2016, Shimkus faced Illinois State Senator Kyle McCarter in the Republican primary. McCarter ran to the political right of Shimkus and criticized his accommodation with the Obama administration as well as national Republican party leadership. Shimkus won the primary with 60.4% of the vote to McCarter's 39.6%.FEC records show that the John S. Fund, the PAC for Shimkus, contributed to former Republican House Majority Leader Tom DeLay in 2005. The fund also made contributions to Peter Roskam, a Republican candidate for the House from Illinois's 6th district, from 2005 to 2008 and to David McSweeney, a Republican candidate for the House from Illinois's 8th district, in 2006. In 2006, the funds treasurer, lobbyist Mark Valente, resigned. Shimkus earlier said he was considering removing Valente, but he did not want to act too quickly because it might suggest there was something improper about their relationship.\n\n\n== Electoral history ==\nThe 20th district was disbanded after the 2000 census due to reapportionment and Illinois' loss of a U.S. House seat, which is why Shimkus faced David D. Phelps, incumbent of the 19th district, in the 2002 election. The 19th district was disbanded after the 2010 census, so Shimkus ran in the redistricted 15th district. The district includes much of the southern portion of the state, including a portion of the Metro-East, which is the Illinois side of the St. Louis area.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nShimkus has been married to the former Karen Muth since 1987. They have three children: David, Joshua, and Daniel. They are members of Holy Cross Lutheran Church (LCMS) in Collinsville.\n\n\n== See also ==\nOpen Fuel Standard Act of 2011\nLautenberg Chemical Safety Act of 2016\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCongressman John Shimkus official U.S. House site\nJohn Shimkus for Congress\nJohn Shimkus at Curlie (based on DMOZ)\nAppearances on C-SPAN\n\nBiography at the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress\nProfile at Vote Smart\nFinancial information (federal office) at the Federal Election Commission\nLegislation sponsored at the Library of Congress"}}},"limits":{"extracts":20}}
