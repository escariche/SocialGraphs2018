His district encompasses the vast majority of the Louisville Metro Area. Since 2013, he has been the only Democratic member of Kentucky's congressional delegation. Yarmuth currently serves as the ranking member of the United States House Committee on the Budget.\n\n\n== Early life, education and career ==\nYarmuth was born in Louisville, Kentucky, the son of Edna E. (n\u00e9e Klein) and Stanley R. Yarmuth. He is descended from Jewish immigrants from Russia and Austria. He graduated from Atherton High School. He later graduated from Yale University, majoring in American Studies, and attended Georgetown University Law Center.He worked for Republican U.S. Senator Marlow Cook from 1971 to 1975, then returned to Louisville and launched his publishing career by founding the Louisville Today magazine, which operated from 1976 to 1982. He later worked as a vice-president of University Relations at the University of Louisville.\n\n\n== Publisher and columnist ==\nIn 1990, Yarmuth founded the Louisville Eccentric Observer (LEO), a weekly newspaper for which he wrote a generally progressive political column that was usually featured on the first page. In 2003, Yarmuth sold LEO to a company owned by Times Publishing Company of Pennsylvania, owner of the Erie Times-News. Yarmuth remained on board as a columnist and consultant until January 2006, when he put his column on hiatus to run for Congress.\n\n\n== U.S. House of Representatives ==\n\n\n=== Tenure ===\nYarmuth took office on January 3, 2007.

Bush, House Minority Leader John Boehner, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.  However, he did vote in favor of the second version of the bailout bill.Yarmuth said he was so \"nauseated\" by a moment of silence for Michael Jackson on the House floor that he left the chamber. \"I thought it was outrageous,\" he said. \"In my two and a half years, we've not done this for anybody else. We've done it for former members and that's about it.\"After defeating Northup for the second time, Yarmuth was rewarded by the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee with a spot on the influential Ways and Means Committee. On the committee, Yarmuth worked on issues on which he campaigned before the 2008 general election: Social Security, pension, Medicare, and Medicaid issues.\nAt a September 2009 town hall meeting, constituents were unhappy with Yarmuth's decision to support the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. \"Yarmuth stayed calm in the face of boos and catcalls from some in the audience\" according to an Associated Press report. \"He warned that the current health care system is an unsustainable drain on businesses and the nation's economy.\"In 2011, Yarmuth introduced a bill alongside Republican Congressman Walter Jones that would seek to overturn key parts of the controversial court case Citizens United v. FEC. The legislation would also give Congress the power to enact mandatory public financing for Congressional candidates and create a national holiday for voting purposes.In 2011, Yarmuth voted against the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 due to a controversial provision which allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.In 2013, Yarmuth introduced the Fair Elections Now Act, which would establish a public financing system for Congressional campaigns.In 2015, Yarmuth once again made an attempt at removing \"dark money\" from the political sphere by Proposing HR 2125, the Keeping our Campaigns Honest Act of 2015, however the bill realistically had no chance of passing in the 114th Congress in which it was proposed.Yarmuth signed onto a \"Medicare for All\" bill in the House, along with 120 other Democrats in 2018, supporting single-payer healthcare.\n\n\n=== Committee assignments ===\nRanking Member, Committee on the Budget\n\n\n=== Party leadership ===\nRegional Whip\n\n\n=== Congressional Caucuses ===\nThe following is a list of John Yarmuth's Congressional Caucus memberships:\n\n\n== Political campaigns ==\n\n\n=== 2006 ===\nYarmuth filed candidacy papers on January 31, 2006, to represent Kentucky's 3rd congressional district.

In a parody of Yarmuth's former Yarmuth & Ziegler debate series, host Stephen Colbert prodded Yarmuth into a point/counterpoint style debate. After agreeing to the \"debate,\" Colbert forced Yarmuth to defend the shredding of kittens in wood chippers, which Yarmuth gamely proceeded to do. Colbert referred to Yarmuth as a real life Bruce Wayne, and presented him with a framed print of his congressional photo with a Batman mask photoshopped over his face.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nYarmuth has served on many boards including the Bingham Child Guidance Center and Kentucky Country Day School.
