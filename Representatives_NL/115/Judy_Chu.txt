They subsequently moved to Los Angeles, near 62nd Street and Normandie Avenue, where Chu was born and grew up until her early teen years, when the family moved to the Bay Area.

Chu led the field in the May 19 special election. However, due to the crowded nature of the primary (eight Democrats and four Republicans filed) she only got 32% of the vote, well short of the 50% vote needed to win outright. In the run-off election, she defeated Republican Betty Chu (her cousin-in-law and a then-Monterey Park City Councilwoman) 62%\u201333%.\n2010\nChu was heavily favored due to the district's heavy Democrat tilt and with a Cook Partisan Voting Index of D+15, it is one of the safest Democratic districts in the nation.

She has worked to pass the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act (H.R. 15). She strongly supports the DREAM Act and has worked for its passage.  She has introduced the Protect Our Workers from Exploitation and Retaliation Act (POWER Act, or H.R. 2169), introduced to stop disreputable employers from exploiting immigrants.In July 2015, Chu went before Congress to speak out against what she sees as the \"shocking\" treatment of women and children held in for-profit detention facilities in the U.S. Comparing them to Japanese internment camps, Chu states the prolonged detention re-traumatizes families, breaks apart the parent-child relationship, and has serious cognitive effects on children.\nAbortionChu cosponsored the Global Sexual and Reproductive Health Act of 2010 which authorizes the President of the United States to support measures providing abortions and other reproduction assistance to women in developing countries.

This was only the fourth time that the U.S. Congress issued an apology to a group of people.\nEthicsIn June 2011 the House Ethics Committee began an investigation after receiving information suggesting that two of Chu's top aides had directed staffers to do campaign tasks during regular work hours.  In the course of the investigation it was found that Chu had sent two emails to her staff on how to respond to aspects of the Ethics Committee's inquiry.  While the Committee found no evidence to support that Chu was aware of the actions of her staff, they did find that the emails represented actions that interfered with the committee's investigation of the matter, and on December 11, 2014, Rep. Chu was formally reprimanded by the House Ethics Committee for interfering with their investigation of her office.\nAdvocating People's Mujahedin of IranIn 2015, The Intercept published an investigative work by Ali Gharib and Eli Clifton, assisted in part by the work of independent researcher Joanne Stocker, indicating that Chu received $11,150 from the People's Mujahedin of Iran (MEK) between January 2009 and September 2012, when the MEK was listed a Foreign Terrorist Organization. She is an advocate of the MEK.\n\n\n==== Committee assignments ====\n\nCommittee on Ways and Means\nSubcommittee on Health\nSubcommittee on Human Resources\nCommittee on Small Business\nSubcommittee on Economic Growth, Tax and Capital Access\n\n\n==== Caucuses ====\nAmerican Sikh Congressional Caucus (Co-Chair)\nCongressional Progressive Caucus (Vice-Chair)\nCongressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (Chair)\nCongressional Taiwan Caucus\nCreative Rights Caucus (Co-founder and Co-chair)\nLGBT Equality Caucus (Member)\nHouse Baltic Caucus\nClimate Solutions Caucus\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nChu married Mike Eng in 1978.
