I remain committed to supporting marriage equality, investments in HIV/AIDS care, treatment and research, and campaigns that take action against bullying in schools.\"On a letter written on February 9, 2010 to President Barack Obama, then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Senator Charles Schumer, S\u00e1nchez explained how \"Currently, U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents may sponsor their spouses (and other immediate family members) for immigration purposes. But, same-sex partners committed to spending their lives together are not recognized as \"families\" under U.S. immigration law and thus do not have this same right.\" and how \"This is unacceptable, and we believe comprehensive immigration reform legislation must include a strong family reunification component inclusive of LGBT families.\"\n\n\n==== Drug policy ====\nS\u00e1nchez is pro-drug reform and supports allowing people with drug-related convictions to receive student loans if they are deemed to be rehabilitated.

The bill has drawn criticism from members of the on-line community, legal scholars, and others who have contended that the bill would infringe the constitutional right of freedom of speech.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nAfter the Arizona State Legislature passed State Senate Bill 1070 and after Arizona Governor Jan Brewer signed it into law, S\u00e1nchez generated controversy when she claimed that the law, and similar laws throughout the United States, were the product of white supremacists: \"There's a concerted effort behind promoting these kinds of laws on a state-by-state basis by people who have ties to white supremacy groups. It's been documented. It's not mainstream politics.\" Rep. Gary Miller called Sanchez's comments \"an outrageous accusation.\" Her comments were also condemned by Steve Poizner.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nS\u00e1nchez married Jim Sullivan on April 13, 2009, in the district office of Congressman John B.

Interweaving childhood vignettes with accounts of serving in Congress, both from California, this refreshing book evades many of the tropes of the typical political memoir\u2014perhaps because these two women are not typical politicians.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Hispanic and Latino Americans in the United States Congress\nWomen in the United States House of Representatives\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCongresswoman Linda Sanchez official U.S. House site\nLinda Sanchez for Congress\nLinda S\u00e1nchez at Curlie (based on DMOZ)\nAppearances on C-SPAN\n\nBiography at the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress\nProfile at Vote Smart\nFinancial information (federal office) at the Federal Election Commission\nLegislation sponsored at the Library of Congress\nProfile at SourceWatch\nBook Review of Dream In Color at Letters On Pages"}}},"limits":{"extracts":20}}
