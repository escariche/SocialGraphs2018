The firm's CEO hired Gallagher after hearing him speak about national security at a business luncheon. Gallagher was looking for additional work as an adjunct instructor for the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay when twenty Green Bay area business people signed a letter urging him to run for Wisconsin's 8th congressional district seat, for which Reid Ribble was not seeking re-election. Gallagher won a primary against Wisconsin state senator Frank Lasee and Forestville village president Terry McNulty. Gallagher then squared off against Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson in the general election.\nIn September 2016, County Board supervisor Mike Thomas endorsed Gallagher in the Appleton Post-Crescent, contrasting his background in business and the Marine Corps with that of Nelson, a \"consummate career politician\" who \"makes decisions based on political implications and the impact it may have on his public image.\" Gallagher, wrote Thomas, \"would be a true citizen representative in Congress.\"During the campaign, Nelson ran an ad saying that Gallagher's failure to denounce certain statements by GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump was a sign of a lack of moral courage. Gallagher replied with his own ad, in which he pointed out that Nelson was questioning the moral courage of a Marine who had done two combat tours. In the end, Gallagher won the election 63 percent to 36 percent, a larger margin than the 16 percent margin that the race was polled at in August 2016.\n\n\n=== Committee assignments and caucus memberships ===\nCommittee assignments\n\nUnited States House Committee on Armed Services\nUnited States House Committee on Homeland Security\nUnited States House Committee on Transportation and InfrastructureCaucus memberships\n\nRepublican Study Committee\nRepublican Main Street Partnership\nClimate Solutions Caucus\n\n\n=== Positions ===\nGallagher has said that his top issues are cutting regulations on businesses and simplifying the tax code, improving national security by building up the nation's military, attacking radical Islamic terrorists and supporting the country's allies, especially Israel, reducing the nation's debt by cutting spending, and increasing revenue through economic growth.
