Walters was chosen as a replacement without an election. She later became Mayor.During her time on the council, Walters opposed efforts to convert Marine Corps Air Station El Toro into a commercial airport.\n\n\n=== California Assembly ===\nIn 2004, Walters was elected to represent the 73rd Assembly District, which includes coastal Orange and San Diego county communities of Laguna Niguel, Laguna Hills, Oceanside, Dana Point, San Clemente, San Juan Capistrano, and Aliso Viejo.

Walters became the Republican nominee for State Treasurer but lost to Lockyer in the general election.\n\n\n=== 2012 California State Senate race ===\nDemocratic candidate and trial lawyer Steve Young filed an unsuccessful civil lawsuit in an attempt to keep Walters' name off of the 2012 ballot. Young's lawsuit challenged Walters' residency in the 37th District; after the California Citizens Redistricting Commission redrew the state's legislative districts in 2011, Walters announced that she had moved from Laguna Nigel to Irvine in order to be eligible to run in the 37th Senate District.\n\n\n== U.S. House of Representatives ==\n\n\n=== 2014 election ===\nOn July 2, 2013, Walters formally announced her candidacy for Congress, to replace Congressman John B.

In the nonpartisan blanket primary, she came in first place in a field of three candidates with 45% of the vote. In the general election, she defeated Democratic candidate Drew Leavens with 65% of the vote.\n\n\n=== 2016 election ===\nIn November 2016, Walters won re-election by 17 points over her Democratic opponent, Ron Varasteh. For the campaign, Walters raised over $2 million.\n\n\n=== 2018 election ===\n\nOn May 14, 2018, Politico reported that Democrats were confident they would oust Walters given that in 2016, Hillary Clinton had carried the district Walters represents, but does not live in, and that she had \"backed some of the most polarizing planks of President Donald Trump's agenda,\" Walters was \"upbeat about surviving the much-predicted Democratic wave.\" Politico noted her support for a popular November ballot referendum. \"The only reason I'm a target is because Hillary Clinton won my district,\" said Walters. \"I got 37,000 more votes than President Trump did.\" However, Paul Ryan's Superpac will not be spending spending money on television network advertising in support of Walters, as it concentrates on districts in which Republicans have better chances. Her general election opponent, Katie Porter said, \"Unfortunately for the families of Orange County, Mimi Walters continues to vote 100 percent with Donald Trump against what\u2019s best for them, so I am here to make sure everyone is aware of what she's doing and the harm that she's creating in our communities and for our families.\" Porter, a consumer advocate and law professor at UC Irvine, finished ahead of two other Democrats and an Independent in the primary.\n\n\n=== Committee assignments ===\nCommittee on the Judiciary\nSubcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property and the Internet\nSubcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law\nCommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure\nSubcommittee on Aviation\nSubcommittee on Highways and Transit\nSubcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials\nRepublican Main Street Partnership\nRepublican Study Committee\n\n\n== Political positions ==\n\n\n=== Abortion and Planned Parenthood ===\nWalters opposes abortion, but has deemphasized the issue during her political campaigns.

The House bill removes state and local tax breaks that many Californians use, such as the mortgage interest deduction. Several House Republicans representing Californian districts voted against the legislation because it raised taxes on Californians. Walters said after the vote that she had received assurances from House Speaker Paul Ryan that a reconciliation version of the bill with the Senate would restore the lost tax breaks that had been removed in the House version. According to the Los Angeles Times, immediately after the vote, the Senate version of the bill \"contains even deeper cuts to state and local tax breaks that are popular with Californians but maintains the mortgage interest deduction at its current level instead of cutting it in half as the House plan does. It also repeals Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate, a move that could further complicate the situation for California members who represent districts with a lot of Obamacare enrollees.\"\n\n\n=== Environment ===\nIn 2015, Walters sponsored and voted for H.R. 1732, a bill that opposed the Waters of the United States rule, which expands the federal government\u2019s jurisdiction to regulate waters and certain adjacent lands.Also in 2015, Walters voted to repeal the limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants set by the Clean Power Plan. \u201cForcing a shift away from traditional energy resources,\u201d she explained, \u201cwould ultimately stifle the economy for years to come and harm consumers\u2019 pocketbooks.\u201d Walters also co-sponsored the Stopping EPA Overreach Act of 2017, which became law, and which declares that there is no legal requirement to regulate global warming.Walters was originally a climate change skeptic, but she began to shift her views after meeting with the Orange County Central chapter of the Citizens' Climate Lobby in 2014. After they explained to her how the market-based approach of Carbon Fee and Dividend could have a positive impact on the climate without expanding government. Walters replied, \"You guys are doing it the right way\". In July 2017, Walters voted to veto the Perry Amendment, which would have defunded Defense Department efforts to track climate change and its threats to military bases.In October 2017, after President Trump pulled out of the Paris Agreement, \u201cWalters officially changed from a climate-change skeptic to a believer...and joined the Congressional Climate Solutions Caucus.\n\n\n=== Healthcare ===\nWalters supports the repeal of Obamacare and voted in 2015 for H.R. 596, the House bill to repeal Obamacare. She also voted for H.R. 3762, the Restoring Americans\u2019 Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, which would have repealed Obamacare.Walters supports repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act (known as Obamacare) with the American Health Care Act, the GOP's replacement plan for Obamacare, which did not come to a vote initially. She said that passing the American Health Care Act \"is a critical step\" towards the goal of rescuing \"this failing healthcare system\".On May 4, 2017, Walters voted to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and pass the American Health Care Act. In early 2017, Walters tweeted that she was \"committed to protecting patients w/ pre-existing conditions to ensure their access to quality, affordable healthcare\". However, USA Today noted that the version of the American Health Care Act that she voted in favor of allows insurance companies to charge higher premiums to individuals with pre-existing conditions (such as cancer, epilepsy, diabetes and pregnancy). Walters was an original cosponsor of H.R. 4684, the Access to Quality Sober Living Act, which would require the Department of Health and Human Services to establish best practices for sober living facilities for opioid addicts. This legislation was written after a subcommittee hearing exposed scams at such facilities.\n\n\n=== Gun control ===\nA May 2018 profile of Walters noted her longtime \u201creputation as a gun-rights advocate.\u201d In the State Assembly, \u201cshe twice voted against bills requiring the microstamping of bullets from automatic firearms,\u201d against \u201cbackground checks for ammunition buyers,\u201d against a ban on \u201clarge-capacity conversion kits,\u201d and against \u201cprohibiting people under domestic violence restraining orders from obtaining firearms.\u201d But during her years in the House, \u201cCalifornia voters\u2019 concerns about school shootings had risen dramatically, with 73 percent of respondents admitting they were worried about a mass shooting at their public school,\u201d with high-school students in Walters's district holding anti-gun rallies.\n\n\n=== Keystone pipeline ===\nWalters voted in support of the Keystone XL Pipeline Act (H.R. 3) in 2015.\n\n\n=== LGBT rights ===\nAs an Assemblywoman, Walters endorsed Proposition 8, which declared same-sex marriage illegal in the state of California. Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-MD) named Walters as one of seven Republican representatives who switched their votes regarding a bill upholding an executive order prohibiting defense contractors from discriminating against people based on their sexual orientation. The identities of the seven vote-switchers were not publicly recorded and none of those named by Hoyer confirmed his claims. PBS reported that under shouts of 'shame', Walters voted against this protection, which ended up narrowly failing.\n\n\n=== Military ===\nIn January 2018, Walters voted for H.R. 695, the 2018 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, saying that she had acted to \u201cfully fund the Department of Defense to ensure our men and women in uniform have the tools and resources they need to keep our country safe... It is imperative our armed forces are properly equipped and ready to meet current and future challenges.\u201dShe voted against allowing veterans access to medical marijuana, if legal in their state, per their Veterans Health Administration doctor's recommendation.\n\n\n=== Nuclear waste ===\nIn March 2018, Walters signed a bipartisan letter in support of funding to restart the licensing process for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository. \u201cJust south of California's 45th district,\u201d she stated, \u201c1,800 tons of spent nuclear fuel sits at the inactive San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS). Unfortunately, our Nation's nuclear waste management system is broken and spent fuel sits at nuclear sites like SONGS with nowhere to go. By law, the Federal government is obligated to take ownership of, and safely store, spent fuel at a permanent repository.\u201d\n\n\n=== Strikes ===\nIn 2014, Walters voted for a bill in committee that banned public transit workers from going on strike.\n\n\n=== Human trafficking ===\nIn February 2018, the House passed H.R. 1865, the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA), introduced by Walters, Ann Wagner (R-Missouri), and Carolyn Maloney (D-New York).

The amended legislation passed with bipartisan support.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nWalters is married and has four children.
