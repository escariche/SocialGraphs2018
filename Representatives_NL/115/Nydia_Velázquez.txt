Vel\u00e1zquez, a Democrat from New York, is the first Puerto Rican woman to be elected to Congress, and she was the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus until January 3, 2011. Her district, located in New York City, was numbered the 12th district from 1993 to 2013 and has been numbered the 7th district since 2013.\n\n\n== Early life, education and career ==\nVel\u00e1zquez was born in Yabucoa, Puerto Rico on March 28, 1953. She grew up in Yabucoa in a small house on the R\u00edo Lim\u00f3n, one of nine children. Her father Don Benito Velazquez was a poor worker in the sugarcane fields who became a self-taught political activist and the founder of a local political party. Political conversations at the dinner table focused on workers' rights. Her mother was Dona Carmen Luisa Serrano.Vel\u00e1zquez attended public schools and skipped three grades as a child. She became the first in her family to graduate high school. She became a student at University of Puerto Rico, R\u00edo Piedras at age 16. In 1974, she received a degree in political science, magna cum laude, and became a teacher. While in college, Vel\u00e1zquez was a supporter of Puerto Rican independence; by the time she ran for Congress in 1992, Vel\u00e1zquez no longer addressed the issue,  \"saying that it must be left up the Puerto Rican people.\"In 1976, Vel\u00e1zquez received an M.A. in political science from New York University. She subsequently served as an instructor of political science at the University of Puerto Rico at Humacao from 1976 to 1981.

From 1989 to 1992 she was named by the governor of Puerto Rico as the director of the Department of Puerto Rican Community Affairs in the United States. In this role, according to a 1992 New York Times profile, \"Velazquez solidified her reputation that night as a street-smart and politically savvy woman who understood the value of solidarity and loyalty to other politicians, community leaders and organized labor.\"Vel\u00e1zquez pioneered Atr\u00e9vete Con Tu Voto, a program that aims to politically empower Latinos in the United States through voter registration and other projects.  The Atr\u00e9vete project spread from New York to Hartford, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Chicago, and Boston, helping Hispanic candidates secure electoral wins.\n\n\n=== Puerto Rico ===\nVel\u00e1zquez has been an advocate for human and civil rights of the Puerto Rican people. In the late 1990s and the 2000s, she was a leader in the Vieques movement, which sought to stop the United States military from using the inhabited island as a bomb testing ground. In May 2000, Vel\u00e1zquez was one of nearly two hundred people arrested (including fellow congressman Luis Guti\u00e9rrez) for refusing to leave the natural habitat the US military wished to continue using as a bombing range. Vel\u00e1zquez was ultimately successful: in May 2003, the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility on Vieques Island was closed; and in May 2004, the U.S. Navy's last remaining base on Puerto Rico, the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station - which employed 1,000 local contractors and contributed $300 million to the local economy - was closed.\n\n\n== U.S. House of Representatives ==\n\n\n=== 1992 election ===\nVel\u00e1zquez ran for Congress in the 1992 election, seeking a seat in the New York's newly-drawn 12th congressional district, which was drawn as a majority-Hispanic district.
