He is a member of the Republican Party. The district is based in the Tri-Cities area in the northeastern portion of the state. In 2017, Roe became chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs.\n\n\n== Early life, education, and career ==\nRoe was born on July 21, 1945 in Clarksville, Tennessee. He graduated from Austin Peay State University in 1967 and earned his Medical Degree from the University of Tennessee College of Medicine in 1972.After graduating from medical school, Roe served in the United States Army Medical Corps, attached to the 2nd Infantry Division at Camp Casey, South Korea. He was discharged as a major in 1974. He then went into OB/GYN practice in Johnson City, retiring after 31 years, including his work as a physician at State of Franklin Healthcare Associates (SOFHA). SOFHA was founded in 1997. After first being elected into the U.S. House of Representatives, Roe purchased a 1.8% ownership share of State of Franklin Healthcare Associates Real Estate Partners with property holdings within the Med-Tech Regional Business Park located in the northern section of Johnson City, Tennessee.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nRoe was first elected to the Johnson City Commission in 2003, serving as vice mayor of Johnson City from 2003\u20132007 and then as mayor from 2007 to 2009.\n\n\n== U.S. House of Representatives ==\n\n\n=== Elections ===\n2008\nRoe defeated incumbent congressman David Davis in the 2008 primary by 500 votes. Davis blamed his loss on votes from Democrats who crossed over to vote for Roe in the open primary. Roe had previously run for the seat in 2006 when 10-year incumbent Bill Jenkins announced his retirement, but lost to Davis in that year's primary.\nRoe defeated Democrat Rob Russell, director of the Writing and Communication Center at East Tennessee State University, in the November general election with 72 percent of the vote.  However, it was widely presumed that Roe had clinched a seat in Congress with his victory in the primary; Republicans have held the 1st District seat continuously since 1881, and for all but four years since 1859.\n\n2010Roe won re-election in 2010 with 80.8% of the vote against Democrat Michael Clark.\n\n\n=== Tenure ===\nThe 1st is known for giving its congressmen very long tenures in Washington; Roe was only the eighth person to hold the seat in 88 years. \nRoe hired Andrew Duke, a former chief of staff for North Carolina Republican congressman Robin Hayes, as his chief of staff. According to National Journal\u2019s 2009 Vote Ratings, he was ranked as the 101st conservative in the House.On February 5, 2013, Roe introduced the National Desert Storm and Desert Shield War Memorial Act (H.R. 503; 113th Congress) into the House. The bill would authorize the National Desert Storm Memorial Association to establish a memorial to honor members of the armed forces who participated in Operation Desert Storm or Operation Desert Shield. Roe said \"I believe we should honor the commitment of every man and woman that honorably serves this country, and I am proud to see this bill move forward.\"During June 2013, WJHL-TV in Johnson City reported that Roe had written a letter to the federal court in Greeneville on the behalf of Dr. William Kincaid, who had plead guilty to one count of receiving in interstate commerce a misbranded drug. Federal prosecutors under the Independent Payment Advisory Board argued that Dr. Kincaid's driving forces for breaking the law were \"money and greed\" and because that decision by Kincaid created a \"substantial risk of harm to patients,\" prosecutors also said Kincaid should spend the maximum three years behind bars for fraudulently obtaining federal reimbursement as a healthcare provider.Roe had initially promised to serve only five terms (10 years) in Congress. However, on February 6, 2018; he announced he would run for a sixth term, saying that he needed to continue the work begun when he became chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee.\n\n\n=== Committee assignments ===\nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs (Chairman)\nCommittee on Education and the Workforce\nSubcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education\nSubcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions\n\n\n=== Congressional Caucus memberships ===\nUnited States Congressional International Conservation Caucus\nPhysician's Caucus\nRepublican Study Committee\nSportsmen's Caucus\nTea Party Caucus\nCongressional Arts Caucus\nAcademic Medicine Caucus \n\n\n== See also ==\nPhysicians in US Congress\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCongressman Phil Roe official U.S. House site\nPhil Roe for Congress\nPhil Roe at Curlie (based on DMOZ)\nAppearances on C-SPAN\n\nBiography at the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress\nProfile at Vote Smart\nFinancial information (federal office) at the Federal Election Commission\nLegislation sponsored at the Library of Congress"}}},"limits":{"extracts":20}}
