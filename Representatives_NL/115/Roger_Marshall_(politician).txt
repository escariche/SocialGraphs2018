Marshall (born August 9, 1960) is an American politician and obstetrician. He is a Republican and the U.S. Representative for Kansas's 1st congressional district. He was elected in 2016.\n\n\n== Pre-political life ==\nMarshall was born in El Dorado, Kansas. He attended Butler Community College before attending Kansas State University, where he received a degree in biochemistry. He received his Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree from the University of Kansas. He completed a residency in obstetrics and gynecology at Bayfront Medical Center in St. Petersburg, Florida.\nMarshall has served as chairman of the Board of Great Bend Regional Hospital and has been a district governor of Rotary International. He also served seven years in the United States Army Reserve reaching the rank of captain.\n\n\n== U.S. House of Representatives ==\n\nOn January 31, 2018, Dr. Marshall was a passenger on a chartered Amtrak train involved in the 2018 Republican Train Wreck. He administered first aid and CPR to the injured.\n\n\n=== 2016 campaign ===\nMarshall ran against incumbent Tim Huelskamp in the Republican Party primary election for Kansas's 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. Marshall ran with the support of many of the state's agricultural groups, who were angered at Huelskamp losing his seat on the House Agriculture Committee, the first time in a century that a Kansan had not been on that panel.On August 2, 2016, Marshall defeated Huelskamp in the Republican primary, 56 percent to 44 percent. No Democrat even filed. In the general election, Marshall won handily, defeating independent Alan LaPolice and Libertarian Kerry Burt with 65.9 percent of the vote. However, the 1st is so heavily Republican that any Democratic challenger would have faced nearly impossible odds in any event. With a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+24, it is the 18th most Republican district in the nation, and among districts in the Midwest, only Nebraska's 3rd congressional district is more Republican.\nMarshall's candidacy was endorsed by the United States Chamber of Commerce, the Kansas Livestock Association, the National Association of Wheat Growers, and the Kansas Farm Bureau, an affiliate of the American Farm Bureau Federation.\n\n\n=== Tenure ===\nRep. Marshall was sworn into office on January 3, 2017. He is a member of the Republican Study Committee. He is a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership and the Congressional Western Caucus.\n\n\n==== Legislature ====\nIn December 2017, Marshall voted in support of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.Marshall voted in favor of the American Health Care Act of 2017.\n\n\n=== Committee assignments ===\nCommittee on Agriculture\nSubcommittee on Commodity Exchanges, Energy, and Credit\nSubcommittee on Nutrition\nSubcommittee on Livestock and Foreign Agriculture\nCommittee on Science, Space, and Technology\nSubcommittee on Oversight (Vice Chair)\nSubcommittee on Research and Technology\nCommittee on Small Business\nSubcommittee on Health and Technology\nSubcommittee on Contracting and Workforce\n\n\n== Political stances ==\n\n\n=== Energy and oil ===\nMarshall supports government funding for renewable energy.\n\n\n=== Environment ===\nMarshall has criticized the Environmental Protection Agency and supports reducing its authority. Marshall supports the federal Renewable Fuel Standard, which requires corn-based ethanol to be blended with gasoline; corn is produced in Marshall's district.\n\n\n=== Health care ===\nMarshall supports repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Like many other Republicans who want the \"health care system to rely on the free market rather than Obamacare's regulations\", Marshall \"measures success in how many people can afford to leave the Medicaid program and enter the private insurance market.\" In opposing the Act's Medicaid expansion, Marshall said in an interview in March 2017, \"Just, like, homeless people... I think just morally, spiritually, socially, (some people) just don't want health care. The Medicaid population, which is [on] a free credit card, as a group, do probably the least preventive medicine and taking care of themselves and eating healthy and exercising. And I'm not judging, I'm just saying socially that's where they are. So there's a group of people that even with unlimited access to health care are only going to use the emergency room when their arm is chopped off or when their pneumonia is so bad they get brought [into] the ER.\" Those who support Medicaid, say that Marshall did not understand how Kansas Medicaid operates. The program provides \"medical coverage for low-income families and disabled Kansans\". Marshall's remark attracted widespread attention and criticism.\n\n\n=== Economic issues ===\n\n\n==== Subsidies ====\nMarshall, who is represents a rural district, supports farm subsidies, such as federal crop insurance. Marshall's support for subsidies gained him the 2016 endorsement of the Kansas Farm Bureau (KFB) in the Republican primary, in which he prevailed over Representative Tim Huelskamp. The KFB opposed Huelskamp's own opposition to some farm subsidies.\n\n\n==== Tax reform ====\nMarshall opposes tax increases on any tax bracket.\n\n\n=== International issues ===\n\n\n==== Immigration and refugees ====\nMarshall supported President Donald Trump's Executive Order 13769, which barred the nationals of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States. However, Marshall supports an immigration bill with a pathway to citizenship for people not living in the US legally; such legislation is supported by the agriculture lobby, which is powerful in Marshall's district.\n\n\n=== Social issues ===\n\n\n==== Abortion ====\nMarshall is anti-abortion.\n\n\n==== Cannabis ====\nMarshall is not \"convinced\" that medical marijuana is safe and provides medicinal benefits. In early 2017, he stated \"I'm not convinced yet so I'm going to be very cautious,\" regarding the legalization of medical marijuana, \"I think there's a path there, but I just haven't seen enough scientific data to say it's a good thing,\"\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMarshall currently lives in Great Bend, Kansas, where he practices medicine.\n\n\n== Electoral history ==\nKansas's 1st congressional district, 2016\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCongressman Roger Marshall official US House website\nRoger Marshall for Congress official campaign website\nRoger Marshall at Curlie (based on DMOZ)\n\nBiography at the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress\nProfile at Vote Smart\nFinancial information (federal office) at the Federal Election Commission\nLegislation sponsored at the Library of Congress\nAppearances on C-SPAN"}}},"limits":{"extracts":20}}
