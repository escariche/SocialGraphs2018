He is a member of the Republican Party. The district includes the entire northern third of the state, from the Kansas border to the Illinois border.  However, the bulk of its population lives in the northern suburbs of Kansas City.\n\n\n== Early life, education and career ==\nGraves was born in Tarkio, Missouri, a small city in the northwestern corner of Missouri not far from the Iowa and Nebraska borders. A lifelong resident of Tarkio, Sam is the son of Janice A. (n\u00e9e Hord) and Samuel Bruce Graves. He graduated from the University of Missouri College of Agriculture in Columbia, Missouri with a degree in Agronomy. He was a member of the Alpha Gamma Sigma fraternity, also known as AG-Sig.\ns\n\n\n== Missouri Legislature ==\nGraves was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives in 1992. After only one term, he was elected to the Missouri Senate in 1994, and then reelected in 1998.\n\n\n== U.S. House of Representatives ==\n\n\n=== Committee assignments ===\nUnited States House Committee on Armed Services\nUnited States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces\nUnited States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness\nCommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure\nUnited States House Transportation Subcommittee on Highways and Transit (Chairman)\nSubcommittee on Aviation\nSubcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials\n\n\n=== Caucus Memberships ===\nCongressional Cement Caucus\n\n\n== Political positions ==\nFollowing the economic crisis of Wall Street in September 2008, Graves voted against the proposed bailout of United States financial system, claiming that it neither \"punished the wrongdoers nor adequately protected the innocent taxpayers, investors and retirees\" caught in the Wall Street banking crisis.\"\nIn January 2014, Graves introduced the TRICARE Family Improvement Act. The bill would allow dependents of military members to stay on their parents' TRICARE health plan after turning age 26. The bill would change current law, which requires those dependents to change to a separate health plan after turning 26.\n\n\n== Todd Graves controversy ==\nGraves is the brother of Todd Graves, former U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Missouri. In October 2008, U.S. Senator Kit Bond apologized to Todd Graves after a U.S. Justice Department report cited Bond forcing Graves out over a disagreement with Representative Graves. Following the report, U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey appointed a special prosecutor to investigate whether former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and other officials involved in the firings of nine U.S. attorneys broke the law (dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy).\n\n\n== Ethics investigation ==\nIn 2009, the House Ethics Committee began inquiring whether or not Graves used his position on the Small Business Committee to invite Brooks Hurst, a longtime friend and a business partner of his wife, to testify at a committee hearing on the federal regulation of biodiesel and ethanol production.  Graves had failed to mention the financial link between Hurst and Lesley Graves at the hearing, which dealt with federal subsidies for renewable fuels.  A review by the independent Office of Congressional Ethics found \"substantial reason to believe that an appearance of conflict of interest was created.\" Graves said in a statement, \"I look forward to a quick review of the facts and answering any questions that the committee may have. I believe that a speedy review will show that all the rules of the House concerning testimony in front of the Small Business Committee were followed.\" The  Office of Congressional Ethics referred the case to the House Ethics committee, which ended its own investigation in October, and released a report finding no ethical violations, as it asserted there was no standard in place for appearances like Hurst's.\n\n\n== Political campaigns ==\n\nIn 2000, Democratic U.S. Representative Pat Danner suddenly retired due to breast cancer. Graves filed within the short period of time left for filing. Graves faced Representative Danner's son, Steve Danner, a former State Senator, in the general election. Graves referred to Danner as a \"tax and spend liberal\" and won the race with 51% of the vote  largely by running up huge margins in the rural areas of the district. He was arguably helped by George W. Bush carrying the district in the 2000 presidential election, a theory known as the coattail effect.\n\n\n=== 2000 ===\n\n\n=== 2002 ===\n\n\n=== 2004 ===\n\n\n=== 2006 ===\n\n\n=== 2008 ===\n\nGraves faced a tougher reelection race in 2008 against Democratic nominee and former Kansas City Mayor Kay Barnes. He gained national attention early in the race for running an ad accusing Barnes of promoting \"San Francisco values.\" It was initially considered one of the hottest races in the country; however, Graves won reelection fairly handily, taking 59 percent of the vote to Barnes's 37 percent.\n\n\n=== 2010 ===\n\n\n=== 2012 ===\n\n\n=== 2014 ===\n\n\n=== 2016 ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCongressman Sam Graves official U.S. House website\nSam Graves for Congress\nSam Graves at Curlie (based on DMOZ)\nAppearances on C-SPAN\n\nBiography at the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress\nProfile at Vote Smart\nFinancial information (federal office) at the Federal Election Commission\nLegislation sponsored at the Library of Congress"}}},"limits":{"extracts":20}}
