Subsequently, Jackson Lee released the following statement:\n\"Since this was not any fault of mine, the way the individual continued to act appeared to be, upon reflection, because I was an African American woman, seemingly an easy target along with the African American flight attendant who was very, very nice...This saddens me, especially at this time of year given all of the things we have to work on to help people. But in the spirit of this season and out of the sincerity of my heart, if it is perceived that I had anything to do with this, I am kind enough to simply say sorry.\"\n\n\n=== Committee assignments ===\nCommittee on Homeland Security\nSubcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence\nSubcommittee on Transportation Security (Ranking Member)\nCommittee on the Judiciary\nSubcommittee on Intellectual Property, Competition, and the Internet\nSubcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security\nSubcommittee on Immigration Policy and Enforcement\n\n\n=== Caucus memberships ===\nJackson Lee is or has been a member of a number of caucuses, including: \n\nThe 9-11 Commission Caucus\nThe Building a Better America Caucus (BABAC)\nThe Congressional Caucus on Global Road Safety\nThe Congressional Human Rights Caucus.\nThe Congressional Algeria Caucus\nThe Congressional Pakistan Caucus\nThe US-Afghan Caucus\nVeterinary Medicine Caucus\nCongressional Progressive Caucus.\nHouse Baltic Caucus\nCongressional Arts Caucus\nAfterschool Caucuses\nCongressional NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus\nUnited States Congressional International Conservation Caucus\n\n\n=== Treatment of staffers ===\nThe Houston Press reported in 1998 that five of Lee's staffers quit that spring: \"According to Lee's former Capitol office executive assistant and events scheduler Rhiannon Burruss, the congresswoman's abrasive ways not only drove off staff members but irritated Continental Airlines staffers to the point where one suggested she fly on a competitor instead.\"In 2011 she was reported to have one of the highest staff turnovers in Congress and to be one of the worst bosses.
