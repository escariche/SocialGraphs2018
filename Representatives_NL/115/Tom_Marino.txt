After graduating from high school, Marino went to work in the factories of central Pennsylvania.

In 2002, Marino was appointed the United States Attorney for the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania by President George W. Bush. During his tenure as U.S. Attorney, Marino led the prosecution of executives of Rite Aid for criminal fraud. The company's former president pleaded guilty to conspiring to inflate income by $1.6 billion and conspiring to obstruct justice.In 2007, Marino resigned from his role as U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. In 2007, the new U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, Peter Smith, confirmed that neither Marino, nor his office, were ever under review or investigation.\n\n\n== U.S. House of Representatives ==\n\n\n=== District ===\nPennsylvania's 10th congressional district, located in central and northeastern Pennsylvania, includes Bradford County, Juniata County, Lycoming County, Mifflin County, Pike County, Snyder County, Sullivan County, Susquehanna County, Union County, Wayne County, and portions of Perry County, Tioga County, Lackawanna County, Monroe County, and Northumberland County.\n\n\n=== Elections ===\n2010\nIn 2010, Marino decided to challenge incumbent Democratic U.S. Congressman Chris Carney of Pennsylvania's 10th congressional district.

He believes that the mentally ill and criminals should not be able to obtain guns.In July 2013, Marino voted against Justin Amash's amendment #413 to H.R. 2397 \"To end authority for the blanket collection of records under the Patriot Act and bar the NSA and other agencies from using Section 215 of the Patriot Act to collect records, including telephone call records, that pertain to persons who are not subject to an investigation under Section 215.\"In 2011, Marino became a co-sponsor of Bill H.R.3261, also known as the Stop Online Piracy Act.\n\n\n=== Pharmaceuticals ===\nIn October 2017, The Washington Post and 60 Minutes reported that Marino was the chief advocate of a 2016 bill that hobbled the ability of the Drug Enforcement Administration to combat the opioid epidemic. Marino introduced the bill, the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act, in 2014 and again in 2015; it failed both times. The 2014 version was opposed by the DEA and the Justice Department, but the 2015 version was sold as an attempt to \"work with the pharmaceutical companies\" and was subject to heavy lobbying. A similar version introduced in the Senate by Orrin Hatch passed both houses of Congress by unanimous consent and was signed into law by President Barack Obama on April 19, 2016. The legislation aimed to weaken the DEA's authority to take enforcement action against drug distributors who supplied unscrupulous physician and pharmacists with opioids for diversion to the black market. Previously, the DEA had fined individuals who profited on suspicious sales of painkillers and repeatedly ignored warnings that the painkillers were sold illegally. The new legislation would have made it \"virtually impossible\" for the DEA to stop these sales, according to internal agency documents, Justice Department documents, and the DEA\u2019s chief administrative law judge. Marino, whose district was heavily affected by the opioid epidemic, declined to comment on the reports.The drug industry spent at least $106 million lobbying Congress on the legislation between 2014 and 2016. McKesson Corporation, AmerisourceBergen, and Cardinal Health spent $13 million lobbying in support of the bill. When Joseph Rannazzisi, the chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration's Office of Diversion Control, strongly criticized the bill, Marino and his cosponsor Marsha Blackburn demanded that the drug diversion enforcer be investigated by the United States Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General. Nothing came of the investigation but Rannazzisi was removed from his position in August and retired in October 2015.\n\n\n== Office of National Drug Control Policy ==\nIn September 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Marino to serve as the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (\"drug czar\").  In October, Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) called on Trump to withdraw Marino's nomination. Trump said he would \"look into\" reports about Marino, putting his nomination in question. On October 17, 2017, Marino withdrew his nomination.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMarino resides outside Williamsport, Pennsylvania, with his wife, Edie, and his two children.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCongressman Tom Marino official U.S. House site\nTom Marino for Congress\nTom Marino at Curlie (based on DMOZ)\nAppearances on C-SPAN\n\nBiography at the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress\nProfile at Vote Smart\nFinancial information (federal office) at the Federal Election Commission\nLegislation sponsored at the Library of Congress"}}},"limits":{"extracts":20}}
